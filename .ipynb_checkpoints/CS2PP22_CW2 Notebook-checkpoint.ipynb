    "# The Evolution of Musical Attributes and Their Impact on the Popularity of Songs in the Digital Era\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement:\n",
    "In the age of digital music, the success of a song is often gauged by its popularity on streaming platforms, which can be influenced by various musical attributes. Understanding how different attributes correlate with popularity can provide insights into listener preferences and inform decisions in the music production and marketing processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze the relationship between various song attributes such as genre, tempo, and explicit content and their popularity scores.\n",
    "To identify trends in the evolution of musical attributes over time and how they relate to shifts in listener engagement and popularity.\n",
    "To determine if there are specific patterns or characteristics that are common among highly popular songs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "Songs with certain attributes, like a higher tempo or inclusion of explicit content, are more likely to achieve high popularity scores.\n",
    "Changes in listener preferences over time will reflect in the prominence of different musical attributes within the most popular songs.\n",
    "There may be a pattern of convergence or divergence in song attributes within top-charting hits compared to songs with lower popularity scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "What song attributes most strongly correlate with high popularity scores within the dataset?\n",
    "How have the common attributes of popular songs changed over the past decade?\n",
    "Can we predict the potential popularity of a song based on its attributes without considering its audio features?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Significance:\n",
    "The project's findings can offer valuable insights for artists, producers, and record labels into the types of song attributes that resonate with listeners in the current music landscape. Additionally, these insights could be used to develop more targeted music recommendation systems that align with evolving listener preferences."

    "Our exploratory data analysis included a correlation heatmap to identify relationships between different attributes of songs in our dataset. Notable correlations are discussed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Album and Song Popularity: There is a strong positive correlation (0.81) between album popularity and song popularity, suggesting that popular albums tend to feature popular songs. This could imply that an album's overall success can positively influence the popularity of its individual tracks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Song Explicitness and Popularity: Song explicitness has a moderate positive correlation (0.25) with song popularity. This could indicate that songs with explicit content have a tendency to be more popular, which may reflect current trends in music consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Song Features and Popularity: Several song features show moderate positive correlations with song popularity, including speechiness (0.56), and energy (0.13). Speechiness measures the presence of spoken words in a track, while energy captures the intensity and activity. Higher values in these features might correspond to traits that are characteristic of popular music.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loudness and Energy: A very strong positive correlation (0.68) is observed between loudness and energy, suggesting that louder tracks are often perceived as more energetic. This is consistent with the idea that higher energy in songs is often associated with higher volume levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Acousticness and Instrumentalness: Both acousticness and instrumentalness have a strong negative correlation with loudness (-0.39 and -0.39 respectively). This implies that songs with more acoustic and instrumental elements tend to be quieter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Danceability, Valence, and Tempo: Danceability shows a small positive correlation with valence (0.21) and tempo (0.21), indicating that songs that are more danceable tend to be happier (higher valence) and faster-paced. However, the correlation is not strong enough to draw definitive conclusions, and further analysis might be required."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Executive Summary\n",
    "In our pursuit to unravel the factors influencing song popularity, we performed a comprehensive exploratory data analysis on a rich dataset of music tracks. Our visual and statistical examination has led to revealing insights into how various attributes, from acoustic features to release timing, impact the popularity of songs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trends Over Time\n",
    "A scatter plot analysis of song popularity over time uncovered a dense cluster of highly popular songs in the most recent decades. This trend could signify a shift in the music industry's distribution strategies or a change in how music is consumed in the digital age. The visualization suggests a more favorable reception to contemporary music, which could be attributed to the proliferation of streaming services and the internet in music distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Genre-Specific Popularity\n",
    "Our genre-based analysis, represented through a boxplot, shed light on the heterogeneity of song popularity within various musical styles. It highlighted that certain genres demonstrate a wide range of popularity, potentially due to the eclectic tastes of listeners within those genres. This variability accentuates the uniqueness of musical genres and their unpredictable impact on a song's success.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Seasonal Influences\n",
    "Delving into seasonal trends, we found that song popularity exhibits slight variations across different seasons. Our boxplot visualization showed that songs released in Spring and Autumn enjoy marginally higher popularity. This seasonal effect hints at a potential strategic timing for releases by the music industry to maximize song reception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation with Musical Attributes\n",
    "Through correlation analysis, we identified key musical attributes that influence song popularity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `song_acousticness`: Negative correlation (-0.183027)\n",
    "- `song_danceability`: Positive correlation (0.086292)\n",
    "- `song_energy`: Positive correlation (0.133483)\n",
    "- `song_loudness`: Strong positive correlation (0.333249)\n",
    "These findings underscore the importance of a song's acoustic profile in determining its popularity, with energetic and louder songs generally being more popular among listeners.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monthly Genre Popularity\n",
    "Investigating further, we observed the monthly variations in genre popularity. Our line plot revealed significant fluctuations, especially in genres such as 'glam rock' and 'detroit hip hop', throughout the year. This fluctuation could be indicative of promotional activities or seasonal listener preferences that influence a genre's popularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "The strongest predictor of song popularity is the album's popularity, suggesting a strong association between the success of individual tracks and the overall reception of the album they belong to. Other positive contributors to a song's popularity include its danceability and energy, aligning with the contemporary trends favoring dynamic and rhythm-driven music.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concluding Remarks\n",
    "In summary, our exploratory analysis has highlighted the multifaceted nature of song popularity, influenced by a blend of intrinsic musical qualities and external factors such as release timing and album reception. The insights garnered from our study offer a foundation for further inquiry into the evolving landscape of music consumption and the intricate tapestry of factors that resonate with listeners worldwide."

    "On the topic of group work, we used git kracken to facilitate a cohesive collaboration of our activities. This came with both good and bad sides as 3 out of the 4 of us had very little experience with it and had to learn how to handle issues when they arose. However working in branches fixed most of these issues and allowed us to code concurrently. On the topic of content within our project, some of our indpeth and exploration of the code overlapped a little which would have been solved with better communication of what exactly we were each implementing within our sections. The overall scope of the analysis we performed on our dataset provides a wide range of different and unique comaprisons and observation of patterns. A more indepth dataset with the statistics of how songs performed over time would have allowed us a much better understanding of the dataset as a whole. Currently with this dataset having only one point of reference date wise for each song, limits us greatly on what we were able to glean from our data. To solve problems like these in future plannning exactly what we want to learn from the data first (acting as our own stakeholders) will help us bet    "

We worked well in the group and openly communicated with each other, using gitkraken to easily edit the notebook along side each other. I encountered some challenges along the way with manipulating the database and with the use of gitkraken as I had hardly used the software previously, but I overcame those struggles as I worked through the coursework. Overall I'm happy with what I accomplished in this coursework though if I were to redo it I would have used a slightly more in-depth dataset to allow for further anaylsis of popularity in songs."
